# Contributing
I am (currently) open to any and all help or criticism on this project! Please feel free to create issues as you encounter them and I'll work to get them fixed. I have a set idea of the scope of this project, but I am always open to new feature suggestions or improvements to my code. Also, if you have code you'd like to contribute, just open a PR and I'll take a look!
